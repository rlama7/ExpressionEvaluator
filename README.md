# CSC 413 - Project One

# The goal of expression evaluator project is to design and program to evaluate a given infix
expression in Java language. In infix expression, an operator is written between the operands.
Our expression evaluator performs the arithmetic operation of given values of the operand A,
B, C and D and operators (+, -, *, /, and ^) including left parenthesis (“(“) and right parenthesis
(“)”).

For example: A + ((B * C) – D /A)
